<h3>Game Synopsis</h3>
<p>
Tank Wars is a third person shooter game where the player plays as a tank and has to fight off an avalanche of enemies in the form of other tanks,
that come in phases. But unlike other shooter games, where the player uses conventional means to take out enemies, such as shooting projectiles, 
the core/main mechanic of shooting has been taken out. Instead, the player is given the ability to manipulate time through their movements and 
use it, together with their spatial awareness, to taking out enemies using their crossfire. 
As stated, the player manipulates time through movement. When the player is stationary, time progresses at a slow rate whereas when they are 
moving, time progresses at a normal rate. This was a mechanic was added to compensate for the removal of the shooting mechanic and not have the 
player at a disadvantage.

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
The given assignment required students to come up with a question that they wanted to investigate using a game, then make a prototype with the 
question at the centre of the game. This could be a certain mechanical aspect of a game, or a dynamic one. Thereafter, they were required to a 
write a report reflecting on their findings and the conclusion they reached though the prototype. The aim was to teach students the process of 
prototyping and how use those prototypes to investigate a certain aspect of their game as well as how to extract information from input given 
by playtesters and use it in a meaningful way. 
<p>

<h2>The question posed</h2>
Could a game made fitting a certain genre but missing one of the core/main mechanics usually found in that genre add to the experience of the 
game?

<h2>Inspirations</h2>
<p>
When creating the prototype, one of the games in which inspiration was taken from was the first person shooter game Superhot, shown below. In 
Superhot, the player attempts to take out enemy targets using guns and other weapons while trying to survive. In addition, the player has the 
ability to manipulate time. When the player moves, time progresses at a normal rate but when the player is stationaty, time progresses slowly.
This creating the opportunity for the player to assess their situation and respond appropriately.
<br>
Another inspiration for the prototype was the mobile game Stickman Tank, shown below, which is a fast-paced 3D tank simulator where the player 
attempts to take out enemy targets using guns and other weapons to progress to different levels.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>Spatial Reasoning</h3> 
<p>
Even though the prototype was to take inspiration from Superhot and Stickman Tank, it was always going to be different due to the question posed.  
Unlike in both games, where the player is able to shoot back and use other weapons to take out enemies as they too try to take out the player, 
for this prototype, that core/main mechanic would be taken out. As a reult, this would force the player to use other means to archieve the task. 
One such means was their spatial reasoning. 

Because players wouldn't have any shooting mechanic, they were forced tio use their spatial reasoning skills to position themselves such that the
enemies take each other out with their crossfire. Unfortunately, during gameplay, players found it difficult to play the game and use their 
spatial reasoning skills to position themselves accordingly as even if their were a few enemies present, there were too many bullets that the 
player had to dodge and therefore, they would die very quickly. In an attemp to balance this out and make things less difficult, the player was 
given the ability to shoot with a limited amount of ammunition as well as immunity. They would sometimes get more ammunition in the form of loot 
by killing enemies. 
</p>

<h3>Enemies Kills</h3>
<p>
During gameplay, players found it frustrating that an enemy would die and drop loot and that loot would disappear without them knowing. Therefore, 
an enemy counter introduced to keep track of the number of enemies present and if any were killed, the counter would decrease, signaling to the 
player that an enemy had been killed.
</p>

<h3>High Score and Kill shots</h3>
<p>
To give players a sense of accomplishment, a timer was introduced to counts upwards and track how long the player had lasted in the game. In 
addition to this, a counter for the number of enemies the player has killed was introduced. Both of these served as the player’s score.
During gameplay, players noted that because there was no way to distinguish between kills that resulted from players using their spatial 
reasoning skills and those that happened randomly, the prototype doesn't fully explore the removal of the core mechanic and really answer the 
question posed.
</p> 

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
From the playtesting sessions and the eventual game play, it was evident that one cannot take out a core mechanic out of a game and expect it to 
run smoothly, as a game works much like a machine and if you take out a certain part from it, it will not run as sufficiently, if not at all. 
After removing the specified mechanic, I found myself trying to fill the void left and this resulted in a lot of gameplay that did not add value 
to the game. Therefore I ended up coming to a compromise where I included the mechanic but restricted it in such a manner that the player would 
experience the game the way I intended for them, even if it isn’t to the fullest.
